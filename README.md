# My Remix App using the Blues Stack

I generated this repository from [the Remix Blues Stack](https://github.com/remix-run/blues-stack), which was created by the Remix team. I'm using this template as a way to learn more about Remix-based architectures, as well as the template's included technologies (like PostgreSQL, Prisma, Docker, and TailwindCSS).
