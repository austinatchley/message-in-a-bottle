# Message in a Bottle

Message in a Bottle is a web application that allows users to create short messages and place them in the virtual "bottle." Users can retrieve these messages at random, and after retrieval, the messages are gone forever

## Development Background

I generated this repository from [the Remix Blues Stack](https://github.com/remix-run/blues-stack), which was created recently by the core Remix team. I'm using this project as a jumping-off point to learn about many web technologies that are new to me, such as PostgreSQL, Prisma, Docker, and TailwindCSS. The Blues Stack template includes boilerplate code tying all of these technologies together. I worked on top of this to build my web app, and it has been a great experience so far

See `/docs` for more information on how to run the project locally, or how to deploy it to [fly.io](https://fly.io/)
